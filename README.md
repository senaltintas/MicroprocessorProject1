# CSE4117 - Microprocessor Project 
The data coming from the keypad is output to sevensegment using FPGA.In addition, some operations were performed using the buttons and switch on the FPGA. For example, increase by 1, rotate the numbers.

STEPS:
1)  QUARTUS II 13.1 is downloaded.Create a SystemVerilog Projec
2)  Some sevensensegment and top modules codes are implemented using SystemVerilog to try sevensegment display.
3)  Cable connections between FPGA and sevensegment display are done.
4)  The relevant pins connected on the FPGA are assigned via Quartus II.
5)  Sevensegment display and keypad tested.
6)  Added extra modules for buttons and switch and used in other related modules.
7)  The relevant pins for buttons and switch are assigned via Quartus II.
8)  Added additional codes for operations using SystemVerilog.
9)  Operations are tested.
10) Done.
